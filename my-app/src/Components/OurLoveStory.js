              Our story began when we were both students at the University of Waterloo. We met through playing board games and a lot of late night <s>lies and deceit</s> <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/128882/the-resistance-avalon"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
              Avalon</a>. (We're both probably at four-digit lifetime games played.)
              We took a leap of faith and started a relationship in less than a month after meeting.
              At that time, we didn't know much about each other except that Amy was "really good at Avalon"! <br/> <br/>
              But it turns out that Caleb doesn't really like Avalon ... "that much". 
              <br/><br/>
              Our relationship would end up changing both our lives as we began altering our plans and goals around each other. 
            We tried our best to make everything work out without compromising or trading off our individual goals and aspirations. 
            We had to learn how to work together and lean on each other for help.
            Despite the long distance and the looming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-body_problem_(career)#:~:text=The%20two-body%20problem%20is%20a%20dilemma%20for%20life,within%20a%20reasonable%20commuting%20distance%20from%20each%20other."  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            two-body problem</a>, we've been making it work and somehow we've been able to be physically together during our major milestones and achievements. 
            It's taken a lot of trips to the airport and support from friends and family.
            We know we're lucky and blessed, and we are extremely thankful to eveyone who helped make our journey easier.

            The challenges we've faced has built communication, prioritization, and synergy into our relationship. 
            Every obstacle we've encountered has been a test on our values, compatibility, loyalty, and patience.
            We've grown so much closer with each other and our families became one. 
            We've learned how to make the most out of our situation and accept what the world has to offer.
            Most importantly, we've learned how to love and appreciate every day as it comes.
            <br/><br/>
            We rushed in quickly, however people often mistake us for a "fresh new couple" still in our "honeymoon phase". 
            It's been 8 years and our love for each other has only grown stronger and stronger!
            <br/><br/>
            We knew we wanted to spend the rest of our lives together for a while now as we got engaged in June of 2022. That's why we're so excited to finally invite you to join us in celebrating the beginning of a new chapter in our lives: Married!
