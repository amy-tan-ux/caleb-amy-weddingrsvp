          <p className="story-text">
            Our story began when we were both students at the University of Waterloo. We met through board games and alot of late night Avalon. 
            We took a leap of faith and started a relationship in less than a month after meeting. We didn't know much about eachother except that Amy was really Go0d at Avalon! <br/><br/>

            But turns out, Caleb didnt really like Avalon... "that much" <br/> <br/>

            Turns out the relationship will end up changing both our lives as we began altering our plans and goals around eachother. 
            We tried our best to make everything "work out" without compromising or trading off our individual goals and aspirations. 
            We had to learn how to work together and lean on eachother for help.
            Dispite the long distance and the constant/active <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-body_problem_(career)#:~:text=The%20two-body%20problem%20is%20a%20dilemma%20for%20life,within%20a%20reasonable%20commuting%20distance%20from%20each%20other."  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            two body problem</a>, we've been making it work and somehow we were still able to be physically together during major milestones and achievements. 
            It took alot of trips to the airport and support from friends and family. 
            We know we're lucky and blessed and we feel extremely thankful for eveyone who helped make our journey easier.<br/><br/>

            The challenges we've faced has built communication, prioritization and synergy into our relationship. 
            Every obstacle we encountered was a test on life/personal values, compatibility, loyalty and patience.
            We ended up growing much more closer with eachother and our families became one. 
            We learned how to make the most out of our situation and accept what the world has to offer. 
            We learned how to live with eachother and without.
            Most importantly we learned to love and appreciate every day as it comes. <br/> <br/>
            
            We rushed in fast however people often mistaken us as a "fresh new couple" still in our "honey moon phase". 
            It's been 8 years and our love for eachother has only grown stronger and stronger! <br/> <br/>
            
            We knew we wanted to spend the rest of our lives together for a while now as we got engaged on June 2022. Thats why we're so excited to finally invite you to join us in celebrating the beginning of a new chapter in our lives, married!! <br/> <br/>
